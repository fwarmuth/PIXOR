# PIXOR: Real-time 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds

This is a copy of PIXOR-philip_huang repository. 

The pixor_ros.py can use the pixor model in ros to publish the markers.

The pixor_ros_20200331.py can publish the markers, the obstacle points and the surrounding points.But the running time is too

long to determine if the point is in the corner.
